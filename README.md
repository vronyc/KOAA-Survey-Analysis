# KOAA-Survey-Analysis

H! My name is Veronica Chistaya. This Jupyter Notebook was created during my internship at KidsOutAndAbout (KOAA). This Jupyter Notebook aims to help analyze the results of KOAA's summer survey. We will explore the general excitement and awareness for the upcoming eclipse. We will also analyze what demographic of people answered the survey.

The files used in this Jupyter Notebook are the Eclipse and demographic files. Both files have been preprocessed from SurveyMonkey. They contain all relevant information from 44 surveys from 44 different cities. All preprocessing was done in google sheets.

There are also two heat maps that were made using Maptive.com that show eclipse excitement and awareness in the US.
