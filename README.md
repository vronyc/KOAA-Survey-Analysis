# KOAA-Survey-Analysis

H! My name is Veronica Chistaya. This jupyter notebook was created as part of my internship at KidsOutAndAbout (KOAA). The purpose of this jupyter notebook is to help analyze the results of KOAA's summer survey. We will explore what the general excitement and awareness for the upcoming eclipse is. We will also analyze what demographic of people answered the survey.

The files used in this jupyter notebook are the eclipse and demographic files. Both files have been preprocessed from SurveyMonkey. They contain all relevant information from 44 surveys from 44 different cities. All preprocessing was done in google sheets.
